Sipsynergy Interview Task
==================

Prerequisites
-------------

- Fork this repository as a starting point.
- Use a docker container to run your project in.
- Include the Dockerfile configuration files, so we can test your code.

Task
----

You will be creating a small Users microservice with a UI.

The endpoints that are required are entirely up to you. However here is a quick example list;
- [GET] /users 
- [GET] /users/{id}
- [POST] /users
- [POST] /users/{id}

The UI should interact with the API you have built.

You may complete the task in any way you see fit (**it does not have to be finished**). 

Conclusion
----------

We would suggest that you use git commits in a way that allows the reviewer to understand the thought process taken to achieve each given goal.

In your repository *PROGRESS* file, you should note your experience with the task, and provide some critique to the codebase as a whole.
