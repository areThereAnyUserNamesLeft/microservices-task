# My Progress - Richard Pape

#### Task breakdown

1. build MS

    Ideas
 - Restful || gRPC? Restful as only just getting to grips with gRPC

 Use suggested endpoints:

 - [GET] /users
 - [GET] /users/{id}
 - [POST] /users
 - [POST] /users/{id}

2. Dockerize

    - Ubuntu
    - MySQL
    - GO
    - ...

3. Build UI

    - Not the crocodile closest to the boat right now


##### Where can I cut corners for speed and not introduce complication of writing from scratch?

Borrow API code from [http://himarsh.org/build-restful-api-microservice-with-go/](http://himarsh.org/build-restful-api-microservice-with-go/) as a boilerplate for a RestAPI and Tests. Also kind of documented which is nice.
